# CISC-475-Team-2

###Overview
>We have been tasked with creating a system that will analyze directory systems from >[eMoneyAdvisor](http://www.emoneyadvisor.com) and output to a visual map that displays the current locations of all >employees based on their devices.  This software will pull and analyze new data on a schedule.
>> We are using two systems:
>> + One functioning as a front end component -- this will display the map.
>> + And a back end componenet, this will analyze the data and output to JSON for the front end.
